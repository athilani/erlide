<p class="block">
	<strong>What if I find a bug, or miss a feature?</strong>
</p>

<p>We know that there is still a lot of work to do. If you encounter problems,
	please follow these steps: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Go to <code>Window->Preferences->Erlang->Report problems</code></li>
	<li>Fill in a summary and a description of what you did when the problem
		occurred</li>
	<li>Pres "Send" and a file will be created in your home directory, attach it to
		a bug report at the <a
			href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=58889&amp;atid=489191"
			>tracker</a> or to a mail to <a
			href="mailto:erlide-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net"
			>erlide-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For feature requests, you can just post a ticket or send a mail, without any
	attachment.</p>

<p class="block">
	<strong>Can I help?</strong>
</p>

<p>Sure! All help is welcome, because there's <strong>plenty</strong> to do.</p>
<p>Register as a developer by contacting <a
		href="mailto:vladdu@users.sourceforge.net">me (Vlad)</a>, or develop by
	yourself some cool feature and submit it later. Please check first with us if it
	isn't already under development.</p>

<p class="block">
	<strong>Why isn't Emacs (or vim) good enough?</strong>
</p>

<p>They are okay, if they work for you. Eclipse is best for project oriented work,
	not for quickly hacking one file. Right now, I believe we are about on par with
	the functionality Emacs offers, and we're going forward (while I haven't seen
	any development for the Erlang mode or Distel since a long time).</p>
